This is a to-do

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d9c265f-78dc-428b-a04c-56c24e8d2a49

 application, with a simple / clean user interface. Once registered, and logged-in, users are able to access the to-do app (incl. historic to-do's if this isn't their first time), where they can add, edit, remove, and complete to-do items. The app functionality has been restricted to gmail domains (to practise middleware, nothing against non-gmail users) - therefore, use gmail when registering to get the complete app experience.
