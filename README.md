The application features a clean, simple user interface. Once registered and logged in, users can access the to-do app, including any previous to-dos if they've logged in before. Within the app, users can add, edit, delete, and mark to-do items as complete. The app is restricted to Gmail domains (as a middleware practice, not a slight to non-Gmail users). Be sure to use a Gmail address when registering to enjoy the full experience.
